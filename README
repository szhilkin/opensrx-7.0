This is the source for the Coraid SRX provided by the previous owners
of the technology.  Apparently, the Coraid infrastructure required to
build release were lost in the turmoil after the reduction in force in
January of 2015.  All internal documentation on how to build the
software was reportedly kept on web based wikis that disappeared.  The
code that was provided us appears to be missing the last version of
the SRX, 7.1.  It is no longer possible to create relases as it was at
Coraid in 2014.

But the main parts of the SRX are here.  The main code is in
src/9/devsr.c, the heart of the SRX.  It implements the AoE target as
well as the RAID code.  It, and the others, are drivers for a Plan 9
kernel that can be loaded from other sources on the network.  One
should be able to combine into current versions of Plan 9 and, with
some work, get an SRX like system.
