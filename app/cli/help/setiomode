The setiomode command sets the access pattern optimization of the specified LUN(s) to sequential or random. When set to sequential, a LUN is optimized for sequential reads using a prefetch mechanism. When set to random a LUN is optimized for random read workloads by disabling prefetch.  The default I/O mode for supported RAID types differs whether the LUN is comprised of all SSD drives versus spinning drives as follows:

RAID type    Spinning default    SSD default
--------------------------------------------
jbod         sequential          random
raid0        sequential          random
raid1        random              random
raid10       random              random
raid5        sequential          sequential
raid6rs      sequential          sequential

RAID types raid5 and raid6rs do not currently support random iomode.

I/O mode may be displayed with the iomode command (see 'help iomode').
