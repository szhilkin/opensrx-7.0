The shelf command assigns the SRX the shelf address that you specify. Choose a number between 0 and 65534 inclusive that is unique among all AoE storage devices attached to the network. The SRX base shelf address must not conflict with other shelf addresses on the SAN. Before you set the SRX base shelf address, unset appears in the SRX prompt. After you set the shelf address, unset is replaced by the shelf address that you specify.
