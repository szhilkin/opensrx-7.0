The iomode command displays the read access pattern optimization setting for configured LUNs. When set to sequential, a LUN is optimized for sequential reads using a prefetch mechanism. When set to random a LUN is optimized for random read workloads by disabling prefetch.  The default I/O mode for supported RAID types differs whether the LUN is comprised of all SSD drives versus spinning drives as follows:

RAID type    Spinning default    SSD default
--------------------------------------------
jbod         sequential          random
raid0        sequential          random
raid1        random              random
raid10       random              random
raid5        sequential          sequential
raid6rs      sequential          sequential

RAID types raid5 and raid6rs do not currently support random iomode.

If no LUNs are specified, the iomode state of all LUNs on the shelf are displayed.

I/O mode may be changed with the setiomode command (see 'help setiomode').
