The restorelun command reads the configuration from all drives in the SRX and assembles LUNs and spares. When issued without arguments, the restorelun command ignores any drives that do not belong to the configured shelf address of the SRX (such as drives removed from another SRX appliance and installed in the SRX). You must use the oldsheflno argument to restore LUNs that once resided on another appliance.  The -l flag reads the configuration from the drives in the SRX and displays the actions that the restorelun command would perform without carrying them out.
