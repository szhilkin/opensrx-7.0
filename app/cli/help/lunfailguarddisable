The lunfailguarddisable command disables lunfailguard on the specified LUNs.   The SRX will attempt to predictively fail a drive that has experienced a SMART threshold exceeded condition.  When lunfailguard is disabled, it bypasses protections that would guard against a drive being failed predictively if such a failure would result in the LUN becoming failed.  Lunfailguard should only be disabled in JBOD configurations that have application-level redundancy.  Warning: if used incorrectly, disabling lunfailguard can result in data loss.  Lunfailguard should only be disabled at the direction of Coraid TAC.
